`karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tiberia99/karabiner-personal-extensions/master/ctrl-copy-paste.json`

(Replace "ctrl-copy-paste.json" with the correct filename for the other ones)

Then allow the browser to open them in Karabiner to finish import.


Alternatively,

Download the files as Zip and unzip into `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications`
